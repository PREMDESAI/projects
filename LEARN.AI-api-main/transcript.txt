00:00:00
last week I went to CES in Las Vegas but
00:00:02
I nearly my pants when I saw this AI
00:00:04
powered smart toilet from Coler it's got
00:00:06
heated seats ambient lighting and
00:00:08
emergency flushing capabilities for
00:00:10
power outages during the apocalypse but
00:00:12
something doesn't smell right with its
00:00:13
$88,500 price tag today we'll look at
00:00:15
all the craziest Tech from CES 2024 to
00:00:18
get a glimpse into our Aid driven
00:00:19
dystopian future it is January 15th 2024
00:00:23
and you're watching the code report the
00:00:24
big theme at CES was you guessed it
00:00:26
artificial intelligence and even implied
00:00:28
that traditional coding langu are dead
00:00:30
in the keynote programming language of
00:00:32
the next decade is not going to be the
00:00:34
traditional way that we've been writing
00:00:36
code it's just going to be natural
00:00:38
language what's funny though is that
00:00:39
literally nothing at CSS is actually
00:00:41
built with AI the reality is that
00:00:43
everything's built with C++ Python and
00:00:45
JavaScript coded by humans however AI is
00:00:48
putting many careers on The Chopping
00:00:49
Block like professional bird watchers
00:00:51
are in big trouble thanks to these new
00:00:52
AI powered binoculars that can
00:00:54
automatically identify government spies
00:00:56
AKA Birds but if you think software
00:00:58
engineering is obsolete another career
00:00:59
you might be considering is a tractor
00:01:01
operator unfortunately those jobs belong
00:01:03
to the robots multiple companies like
00:01:05
John Deere are now showcasing driverless
00:01:07
tractors and Hyundai's concept X
00:01:09
excavator in the near future robots like
00:01:11
this will build in police linear smart
00:01:13
cities just like the one that's under
00:01:14
construction in neom Saudi Arabia right
00:01:16
now with minimal manual labor or
00:01:18
supervision from humans but even if you
00:01:20
find yourself doing manual labor in the
00:01:21
future it'll be a lot more productive
00:01:23
thanks to AI powered exoskeletons this
00:01:26
prox exoskeleton from hypershell is an
00:01:28
AI powered suit that can make you run
00:01:30
faster jump higher and kickass harder
00:01:32
it's got a 1 horsepower motor that can
00:01:34
get you running over 12 mph the most
00:01:36
obvious application for such a tool is
00:01:38
for the military and law enforcement
00:01:39
eventually every police officer and
00:01:41
Soldier will be an Unstoppable Cyborg
00:01:43
and that's great for Humanity because we
00:01:44
can finally eradicate crime once and for
00:01:46
all but crime is a small problem
00:01:48
compared to the upcoming climate
00:01:49
catastrophe if we don't do something
00:01:51
algor is predicting the ice caps will be
00:01:53
totally melted by 2013 it's all your
00:01:55
fault but luckily our trusted world
00:01:56
leaders are flying around on their
00:01:58
private jets trying to figure out a
00:01:59
solution tion like did you know Bill
00:02:00
Gates had to buy four different private
00:02:02
jets that's your fault he's trying to
00:02:03
save the world from useless carbon
00:02:05
emitters like you but don't worry a
00:02:06
final solution is coming another huge
00:02:08
theme at CES was electric vehicles
00:02:10
Mercedes dropped a new all electric G
00:02:12
wagon and there are tons of different
00:02:13
cool looking EVS from Brands I've never
00:02:15
even heard of and this is all happening
00:02:17
while demand is slowing for EVS in the
00:02:19
United States which means these cars
00:02:20
will likely get cheaper and cheaper in
00:02:22
the years ahead but EVS aren't even all
00:02:23
that much better for the environment
00:02:25
compared to ice the real problem is that
00:02:26
there's too many humans consuming too
00:02:28
much stuff but most of them are not
00:02:29
willing to get into the sarop Pod yet on
00:02:31
top of that many people have pets like
00:02:33
cats and dogs also useless carbon
00:02:35
emitters luckily Samsung introduced a
00:02:37
new robot called Bali a cute little
00:02:39
robot kind of like Wall-E it's a far
00:02:40
superior cat or dog replacement it's
00:02:42
powered by Ai and has a built-in
00:02:44
projector that can play videos on any
00:02:46
wall or act as a little security bot
00:02:48
that can keep your house safe while
00:02:49
you're away pretty cool but one of the
00:02:51
most hyped up products at CES was the
00:02:53
rabbit R1 it's a handheld AI assistant
00:02:56
that's kind of like if a smartphone and
00:02:57
Alexa had a baby basically it Con
00:02:59
conects to the apps in your phone and
00:03:01
allows you to control them with natural
00:03:02
language as opposed to their actual uis
00:03:05
thanks to their own custom Foundation
00:03:06
model which they call a large action
00:03:08
model some people have called this the
00:03:10
iPhone moment for the AI era essentially
00:03:12
the rabbit R1 makes UI obsolete you can
00:03:15
remove the word front- end development
00:03:16
from the dictionary because with the
00:03:17
rabbit R1 all you have to do is talk
00:03:19
into the device like you're talking to a
00:03:20
human and it can do all those things you
00:03:22
used to do with your fingers on your
00:03:23
apps the rabbit sold all 10,000 of its
00:03:25
units the first day it was released but
00:03:27
personally I think this thing is
00:03:28
overhyped you could Lally just build an
00:03:30
app that does the same thing instead of
00:03:32
carrying a second piece of Hardware
00:03:33
around with you oh wait it looks like
00:03:35
someone already built that app with
00:03:36
flutter overall CES was totally
00:03:37
overwhelming like I didn't even mention
00:03:39
the Y brush that can brush your teeth in
00:03:40
10 seconds or the new Hyundai electric
00:03:42
air taxi or the transparent TVs from
00:03:44
Samsung and LG or the analog keyboard
00:03:46
for your smartphone or how about the
00:03:48
smart lamp that watches you at all times
00:03:49
to keep you safe or come take a load off
00:03:51
with one of these fully immersive VR and
00:03:53
AI powered reciprocating devices CES was
00:03:55
a lot of fun but now it's your turn to
00:03:57
serve your life's purpose and go out and
00:03:59
buy all this useless Crow this has been
00:04:00
the code report thanks for watching and
00:04:02
I will see you in the next one
