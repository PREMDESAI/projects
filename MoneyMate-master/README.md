# Moneymate - Personal Finance Management App for Teenagers

Moneymate is a personal finance management app designed specifically for teenagers to track their expenses and investment opportunities in stocks and crypto. Built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB, Moneymate also has AI-integrated features like receipt scanning and smart expense tracking.

## The Problem

With online transactions becoming more and more common, people are spending more money than ever. However, they often struggle to track their expenses, as the transaction history only shows the amount and transaction ID. After a few days, users may not remember what they spent the money on.

## The Solution

Moneymate helps users with smart expense tracking. Every time a payment is made, the app prompts users to categorize the expense. Moneymate then remembers the categorization and tags every expense in the future.

The app also uses state-of-the-art ML algorithms to analyze the data and provide insights on where to optimize spending. Moneymate has an inbuilt AI finance mentor that looks at the user's data and helps them make informed investment decisions in stocks and crypto through the app's inbuilt investment platform.

## Features

- Expenses Tracking: Users can track their expenses by category (e.g. food, transportation, entertainment) and view their spending habits over time.
- Investment Opportunities: Users can view investment opportunities in stocks and crypto and track their portfolio performance.
- User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed with a fun and user-intuitive interface to engage teenagers and encourage financial literacy.
- Secure Login: The app requires a secure login to ensure the privacy of user data.
- Personalized Dashboard: Users can customize their dashboard to display the information that is most relevant to them.
- AI-integrated Features: Users can scan their receipts with the app's AI technology to automatically categorize their expenses.
